# Open Mercato Multi-Vendor Marketplace

<p align="center"><img src="assets/open-mercato-logo.png" /></p>

Welcome to the **OpenMercato** project! We're playing here with an idea for Open Source Multi-Vendor marketplace product. 

The project is designed API First and headless. Based on NestJS, MongoDB, TypeScript and GraphQL.

We're starting easy, with kind of modular-monolith architecture approach including 3 base apps:

- **api** - which is the core API including authorization, listings, reviews.
- **admin** - which is React (and material-ui) based admin panel and merchant center for the vendors,
- **marketplace-starter** - also React based frontend app, a template for all soft of multi vendor marketplace apps.
